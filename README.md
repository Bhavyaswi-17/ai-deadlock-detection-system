# ai-deadlock-detection-system
AI-Powered Deadlock Detection System A real-time system that uses machine learning and wait-for graph analysis to predict, detect, and resolve deadlocks. Includes a deadlock simulator, detection engine, ML-based predictor, API services, and optional dashboard visualization.

## ✅ Features
- Deadlock simulation environment
- Real-time wait-for graph generation
- Cycle detection algorithm
- ML-based deadlock prediction
- Visualization dashboard
- API backend for real-time monitoring

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+ – Main programming language
- NetworkX – For creating and analyzing wait-for graphs
- Scikit-Learn – For predicting potential deadlocks using ML
- FastAPI– For real-time API interface
- Matplotlib / Plotly – For visualizing deadlocks and resources
- Git & GitHub – Version control
